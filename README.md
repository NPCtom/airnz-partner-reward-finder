ðŸ‘‹ As a side project I wanted to see if I could automate some of the repetitive searching involved in looking for Air New Zealand Star Alliance reward fares.

This Chrome extension is a proof of concept only. It scans across multiple dates (Â±4 weeks) and highlights when business class rewards are available. 

## Features
- Displays a small user interface on the reward portal.
- Scans across available dates and shows status updates.
- Fixes the "Service unavailable" error that apeears on some searches.
- Log to console and export to CSV.
- Compatible with Chrome.

## Installation
1. [Clone or download this repo](https://github.com/NPCtom/airnz-partner-reward-finder/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner.

3. Ensure you click on **Show dates** for each new search, otherwise the tool will search using the dates from the previous search.
